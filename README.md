Computer Vision: Calibration
==============================
## Computer Vision Topics: Pinhole Camera, Vanishing Points, Orthocenter Theorem, Direct Parameter Calibration Method 

This repository contains material exploring the concepts of the pinhole camera and vanishing points resulted from the image plane projection of parallel lines. These concepts can then be used to calibrate a virtual camera using calibration points using concepts like the orthocenter theorem and direct parameter calibration method.
